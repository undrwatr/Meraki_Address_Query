# Meraki_Address_Query
This goes through and queries the addresses of all of the networks for a given Organization

This will create two files address.txt and error.txt, If anything doesn't work it will go into error.txt otherwise you will get all of the addresses for the networks within a specific organization. I used this several times to make sure that all of the addresses were correct for the networks so that they would show up correctly on the map. I could then go through and fix any of the addresses that were duplicates or that were in the wrong place. It only needs two variables from your cred file organization and your api key.
